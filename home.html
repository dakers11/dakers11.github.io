    <h1>Emma Grace,</h1>
    <p>I never imagined that I would be in this situationâ€”madly in love with a girl from Kansas. I keep asking why, or how, but it doesn't even matter anymore. You and I were supposed to meet as oddly as we did, connect as fast, and fall as hard as we did. Regarding you and how I feel, I am certain of both. You are so beautiful inside and out, and I am so grateful to now have you in my life. You never fail to put a smile on my face and make my days tenfold. I truly can't imagine a life without you in it. I admire your drive, compassion, and strength that you carry everyday with you. Thank you for being a light in the darkness, and always staying true to your amazing self :)</p>
